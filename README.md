# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction

### Relevance Of The Project
Recommendation systems predict user preferences and suggest relevant content, such as movies, based on past interactions. They are widely used in online platforms like Instagram and Flipkart to enhance user experience.

## Literature Review

### Recent Work
Recent advancements in movie recommendation systems focus on improving accuracy and personalization through techniques like deep learning, hybrid approaches, and real-time recommendations.

### Pros and Cons
| Method       | Pros                                                        | Cons                                                           |
